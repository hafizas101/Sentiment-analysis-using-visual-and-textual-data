1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Let’s talk about climate change.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,480
People are calling it the crisis of our time, and  it is.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,240
“climate change

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,480
“climate

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,040
change”

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,400
“climate

7
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,840
changes”

8
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,160
“climate

9
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
change”

10
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
But it’s easy to get lost in this story.

11
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,520
The science is dense, and politics get in the way.

12
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,080
World leaders are meeting in Madrid to talk about the climate crisis

13
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
and how to slow it down.

14
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,880
And they’re under pressure from millions of people

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,160
around the world calling for concrete action.

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,560
The empty promises are the same and the inaction is the same.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,480
So what exactly are we doing wrong and how do we fix it?

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,559
We’re going to kick this off with some basic science.

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,920
So bear with me, because this is important.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
Look at this graph.

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,560
These are the levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,160
over hundreds of thousands of years.

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,080
But this spike in carbon dioxide at the very end?

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,680
That took off during the industrial revolution.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,239
We started breaking CO2 records in 1950, and we haven’t stopped since.

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,360
why?

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,920
Well, scientists say there’s a 95% chance that human activity is the cause.

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,560
We’ve been burning more and more fossil fuels like oil and coal, which

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,000
release CO2, to power our homes, factories, airplanes and cars.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,440
There’s also a lot more of us. The global population

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,880
has tripled in the past 70 years.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,839
And we’re consuming more products from animals

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,720
that release another pollutant called Methane.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,000
So all those gases are in the air, and when sunlight gets into the earth’s

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,040
atmosphere, some of the heat gets trapped, and the planet gets warmer.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,400
That’s why they call it the “Greenhouse Effect”.

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,800
But the concern is not that the earth is getting warmer.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,399
But the concern is not that the earth is getting warmer.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,720
“It’s actually the warmest temperature on Earth since the last ice age

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
since 10 thousand years ago.”

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,520
The UN says that right now, our world is about 1 degree hotter

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,160
than pre-industrial times. That’s around the year 1800.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,199
Which is okay. In fact, the UN says if we warm by 1.5 degrees

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,880
before the end of the century we should be fine.

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,920
The UN says even 2 degrees would 'probably' be alright.

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,839
But again, the problem is speed. Because right now, we are

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,720
on track to hit 1.5 degrees in only ten years.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,280
And If we don't slow that warming down, it could mean catastrophe

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,240
within my lifetime, and maybe yours too.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,480
And we’re already getting a taste.

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,600
“Climate change is here. Climate change is happening. We are well into

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,359
the 6th mass extinction event.”

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,120
”Europe is currently colder than the Artic.”

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,400
“More than a thousand people being rescued just in

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
the early morning hours of Sunday.”

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
“Millions of people are likely to suffer worsening food and water shortages.”

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,520
‘The drought that’s now in its tenth year is a phenomena that’s here to stay.’

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,320
“We’ve never seen a year’s worth of rain in less than seven days.”

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Sea levels are rising about 3 millimetres a year

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,640
because seawater expands as temperatures get warmer.

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,440
Melting ice sheets and glaciers also add trillions

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,320
of tons of freshwater into our oceans.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,519
People around the world are already losing their homes.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,680
And if things carry on, millions more of us will have to pack up too.

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,200
Entire coastal cities could be underwater within 80 years.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,880
Like Miami in the US

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,160
or Osaka in Japan.

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,440
Entire island nations in the pacific could completely disappear.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,400
“Natural disasters becoming more and more intense, more frequent

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,760
with devastating consequences. The dramatic impacts of droughts

71
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,519
in different parts of the world, all of this is creating a situation

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,040
that is a real threat to humankind. And we are not doing enough.”

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,920
“If 99% of doctors said to you, ‘take this medicine, or you will get really sick and

74
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,320
probably die’ you would take it , who wouldn’t take it?

75
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,160
the problem is, at the moment, we don’t have any medicine.”

76
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
Now, there is a plan to slow all this down.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,279
Back in 2016, world leaders signed the so-called ‘Paris Agreement’.

78
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,000
And the big pledge is to cap temperatures rising by 1.5 degrees

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,720
or a maximum of 2,  before the year 2100.

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,680
So countries set their own targets on how much CO2 they emit.

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
But here’s the thing

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,000
Three years after the agreement, global CO2 levels are still going up.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,840
“CO2 emissions have been going up the last year by two per cent

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,679
so that's actually above the average of the last ten years.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,920
So it's started to increase again and it doesn't look too good.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,560
In some ways, we’re going backwards.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
"The United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,200
Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens

89
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,080
the agreement imposes on our country."

90
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,560
The US, one of the world’s biggest polluters, has pulled out

91
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,080
of the Paris deal. Russia and China are accused of not giving themselves ambitious targets in the first place.

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,359
ambitious targets in the first place.

93
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,880
Turkey and Poland want to build more power plants that use coal.

94
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
And then there’s the sceptics.

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,640
It’s a political decision,  that it’s man-made global warming.

96
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,960
We forced the computer models to say AHA!

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,120
Human influence, CO2 and other stuff.

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,680
“The ground base temperature data has been massaged to show

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,480
an increase but the satellite data shows no increase.”

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,480
On the other hand, there is positive momentum. There’s more awareness

101
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,840
and some countries are making progress. India, Morocco, and

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,440
The Gambia have massive renewable energy projects.

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,080
There are different countries doing different things really successfully

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,440
some countries are, for example, making all public transport free

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,760
in the cities. What a great way to encourage people out of their cars.

106
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,000
But experts say what’s needed now is an even bigger push

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,080
to change everything about the way we run our world.

108
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,520
Business as usual has got to change. Politics as usual has got to change

109
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,280
In order to combat that we have to change the system that

110
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
has allowed it to happen. You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet.

111
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,760
And everyone can do that by shifting to renewable energy, reducing

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,280
the use of cars, use trains more, cycle more, eat less meat

113
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,239
consume a bit more carefully.

114
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,440
So where does that leave us? Well there’s only so much bike-riding

115
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,560
and light-bulb replacing you and I can do everyday.

116
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,000
But the truth is that it’s those everyday things

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
that are going to change anyway.

118
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,320
Even coffee could run out if farmers can’t grow it.

119
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,000
So the expert advice? Is that it’s down to all of us, to change our ways and

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
shake things up, or climate change is going to do it for us.
